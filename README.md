# ksz_CIB_forecasts

In the folder Code there is code to produce forecasts for the signal to noise of the ksz tomography estimator using the CIB as a tracer.

The CIB power spectra are computed in halomodel.py

The Angular power spectra are computed in Code/all_cib_cls.py

The forecast are done with Code/driver_CIB.py using ksz_CIB_estimator.pyx
